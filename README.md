## 🎯 How the Game Works

1. The user selects **three numbers (0–27)**.
2. A lottery ticket with **three random digits (0–9)** is generated.
3. The **sum of the ticket digits** is calculated.
4. If the sum matches **any one** of the selected numbers, the user **wins** 🏆.
5. The user can generate a new ticket and try again.

## 💡 Probability Note

Ticket sums closer to the middle range (10–18) occur more frequently due to the nature of random combinations.  
However, **winning is still random**, and no number guarantees a win.
